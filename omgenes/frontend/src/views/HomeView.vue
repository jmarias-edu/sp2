<b>Thank you so much for showing interest</b> in testing my web application, unfortunately I am <b>no longer accepting responses</b> but you can still try out the site with the <b>instructions below!</b>

<b>OMGenes</b> is a website for <b>viewing and creating VCF Files</b> through an open-source <b>Genome Browser and Variant Caller</b>. I have provided the files needed in the <b>zip file below</b> for testing, you just have to follow the rest of the instructions below (It'll be quick I promise ^^)

For testing, I will be providing <b>Reference Genomes, VCF Files, and Sample Genomes for Yeast and COVID-19 for testing</b>, they will be linked both below and in the instructions.

Below are the <b>full instructions and testing files.</b>
