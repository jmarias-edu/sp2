Waiting at most 10 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in rule refIndex in file /mnt/Files/Jarem/Academics/4th Year 2nd Sem 2023-2024/SP-Repository/sp2/sp2/snakemake testing/snakefile, line 5:
Job 3  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 10 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
{input.ref}.amb (missing locally, parent dir not present)
{input.ref}.ann (missing locally, parent dir not present)
{input.ref}.bwt (missing locally, parent dir not present)
{input.ref}.pac (missing locally, parent dir not present)
{input.ref}.sa (missing locally, parent dir not present)
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
