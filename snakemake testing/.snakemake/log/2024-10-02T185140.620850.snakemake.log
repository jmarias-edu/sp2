Error in rule sort:
    jobid: 1
    input: mapped_reads/mapped.bam
    output: sorted_reads/sorted.bam
    shell:
        samtools sort -T ./sorted_reads/sorted.bam-O bam mapped_reads/mapped.bam > sorted_reads/sorted.bam
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job sort since they might be corrupted:
sorted_reads/sorted.bam
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
