Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in rule refIndex in file /mnt/Files/Jarem/Academics/4th Year 2nd Sem 2023-2024/SP-Repository/sp2/sp2/snakemake testing/snakefile, line 5:
Job 3  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
{input.ref}.amb (missing locally, parent dir not present)
{input.ref}.ann (missing locally, parent dir not present)
{input.ref}.bwt (missing locally, parent dir not present)
{input.ref}.pac (missing locally, parent dir not present)
{input.ref}.sa (missing locally, parent dir not present)
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
