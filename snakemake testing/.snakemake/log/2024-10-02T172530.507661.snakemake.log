Relative file path './data/genome.fa' starts with './'. This is redundant and strongly discouraged. It can also lead to inconsistent results of the file-matching approach used by Snakemake. You can simply omit the './' for relative file paths.

        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job align_reads since they might be corrupted:
target_aligned.bam
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
