MissingOutputException in rule all in file /mnt/Files/Jarem/Academics/4th Year 2nd Sem 2023-2024/SP-Repository/sp2/sp2/snakemake testing/snakefile, line 1:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
variant.vcf (missing locally, parent dir not present)
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
