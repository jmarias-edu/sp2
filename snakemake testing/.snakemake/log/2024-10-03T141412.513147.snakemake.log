Building DAG of jobs...
Relative file path './data/genome.fa' starts with './'. This is redundant and strongly discouraged. It can also lead to inconsistent results of the file-matching approach used by Snakemake. You can simply omit the './' for relative file paths.
Relative file path './data/A.fastq' starts with './'. This is redundant and strongly discouraged. It can also lead to inconsistent results of the file-matching approach used by Snakemake. You can simply omit the './' for relative file paths.

MissingOutputException in rule map in file /mnt/Files/Jarem/Academics/4th Year 2nd Sem 2023-2024/SP-Repository/sp2/sp2/snakemake testing/snakefile, line 15:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
mapped_reads/mapped.bam (missing locally, parent dir contents: )
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
