Error in rule map:
    jobid: 3
    input: data/genome.fa, data/A.fastq
    output: mapped_reads/mapped.bam
    shell:

        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job map since they might be corrupted:
mapped_reads/mapped.bam
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
